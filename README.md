# babilonpremium
This is my first commercial application. Certainly not written in accordance with the art of programming. I know that.

Commity I did direct to Heroku so they are not here. The application works and the client is satisfied.

I used:
Django restframework, jquery (ajax), css, bootstrap 4, endpoint for client(termal printer - on local machine)

others: SmsApi, Drivers module, automatic order status changes

Apps for network restaurant. Installed on heroku.com and (most commits are there)
